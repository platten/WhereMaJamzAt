Intro:
-------

I needed to try out some web scrapping. You see there is this radio I like to listen to. Or at least used to like
to listen to it... when it was available outside the US, and I thought it might be nice to create a playlist
of songs so I could "emulate" the experience. Maybe without the useless talk. So this is how WhereMaJamzAt.

BTW: I condone piracy, so this is just an educational experiment, here.
